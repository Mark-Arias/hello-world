# hello-world
The first source code upload I ever made. A simple and humble hello world program to get a hang of the mechanics.

My name is Mark.

I am an aspring professional Software Engineer.
My favorite coding language is Swift, although I do very much enjoy C++ and Java.
I am a huge fan of Linux and the command line interface. While i initially was put off by its steep learning curve
I have come to really appreciate the ways it contrasts and at the same time complements modern gui environments.

Note to future self:

The robots have not become self aware and taken the world over yet as of 2018.
Stay tuned!
